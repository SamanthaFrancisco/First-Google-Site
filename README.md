# Strategy-and-Performance-Google-Site
This was my first git. It was a project for an internship; the output is a one-stop-hub for a Philippine Hydropower Company and the platform used was Google Sites, a low-code and free platform.

>>The functions of this site were the following:
#To be able to disseminate information to intended customers.
#To be able to integrate non-native apps/sites used by the company, e.g., Kissflow, Monday.com
#To serve as a learning platform to employees enrolled in company enablement programs
#To archive insights from strategy meetings, with files accessible only to key officers

My intention was to document my front-end progress as I learned more about Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Js.

I have already released the site and it's being used for our intended functions as described above.

Please let me know if you have any tips for improvement :)
